summary: Bug in jQuery validate
---

A quick one... Just had a situation where we were adding the maxlength attribute to a html input, and then trying to use the excellent jQuery Validate plugin to validate the form... Resulting in an invalid form! Doh!!

Seems it is a bug...

[Here is the fix.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3365276/text-inputs-with-maxlength-not-validating-with-jquery-validate)

Doh! Hopefully fixed soon.

Happy coding!!
