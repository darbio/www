Some may know that I went along to the Azure DevCamp in Sydney yesterday.

I have some plans for Azure, and hadn't really had a chance to have a play with it before yesterday... Well.. I was impressed, and had a lot of fun!

The new portal is pretty schmick! And makes it easy to create:

<ul>
	<li>Websites</li>
	<li>Cloud Services</li>
	<li>Storage</li>
	<li>SQL DB's</li>
</ul>
Best thing is that, during preview, it is free for 90 days - with a 30% discount on certain functions within the preview time.
<h1>My favourite Azure feature was...</h1>
<strong>Websites</strong>

Currently you can have free testing websites. After the preview, you will be allowed 10 free websites, as long as they end in `.azurewebsites.net` which is ok if you want a staging/testing area.

Unfortunately, the shared instances do not allow you to bring your own domain, but with a reserved instance, you can use a CNAME record on your DNS to redirect your TLD to the hosted site.

Hopefully Microsoft will lift this restriction and allow us to pay for a shared instance with our own domains (12 cents per hour isn't justifiable for many, unless you host multiple websites on there). Until then, it's 8 cents per hour (<a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/" target="_blank">Calculator</a>) during the preview.

## My favourite part was...

<strong>Winning an XBox 360!</strong>

Part of the Conference involved a "Windows Azure Challenge" set up by <a title="Coatsy" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/acoat/">Andrew Coates</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/coatsy">@coatsy</a>) from Microsoft here in Sydney. Which apparently I won the first leg of... Just goes to show that anyone can do Azure!

I know I need a haircut... And it was a cold 8 degrees in Sydney - hence the Arctic exposure suit!). Thanks to <a href="http://flickr.com/coderedpaul" target="_blank">Paul from CodeRed</a> for the pic.

<h1>Next...</h1>
